a primer for 504/507
Provide a summary of the variables you created, an explanation of the function, and the expected output based on example data.
The following variables with assign values: 
A number variable : 5,6,5
A string variable : John, Doe
A list : [1,2,3,4,5] ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
A dictionary that contains at least 3 key:value pairs - which includes at least one list and one nested dictionary 
 'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22],
    'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Seattle'],
    "dictionary2" :{"value1": 1, "value2":2}
Create a function that takes in at least two inputs (otherwise called variables or arguments) and write some a calculation that involves a if/else statement [like what we did during class with the blood pressure example]
the First function:
the output is "your blood pressure is hypertensiv at : 140/90
Blood Pressure Analysis:  (140,90)

The second function with the list of Bloodpressure measures: [120, 140, 109, 138]
your blood pressure is WNL, BP systolic measure is: 120
Your blood pressure is hypertensive at : 140
your blood pressure is WNL, BP systoic measure is : 138
Your blood pressure is a little concern at: 138
Blood pressure analysis : [120, 140, 109, 138]
